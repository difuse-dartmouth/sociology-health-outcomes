# Module Overview
## Module Objective 
Give students exposure to data science through the analysis and visualization of data, and interpreting and communicating results in the context of sociological questions about the relationship between statistical data from Texas counties and self-reported health measures.

## Student Learning Objectives
1.	Understand how to use data visualization methods.
2.	Generate and test hypotheses about relationships between different variables and health outcomes.
3.	Build and use models to predict outcomes.

## Module Description
Students complete four modules that each analyze how different factors might affect health outcomes. The module uses the state of Texas as a case study that will help students come to broader conclusions about the geography of health disparities in the United States. The first module focuses on social and economic factors, the second on health behaviors, the third on physical environment, and the fourth on access to health care. Students visualize how each of these factors relates to self-rated health, through an analysis of an interactive map that overlays these data. Students generate and test hypotheses about relationships between aspects of the data and the module tools include visualizations to identify correlation and a linear regression tool, allowing a deeper statistical analysis.

### Data
The module uses statistical data from Texas counties including measures of high school graduation, median household income, smoking, physical inactivity, food insecurity, air pollution, severe housing problems, unisured, mental health providers, and self-reported health.

### Platform
This module uses Python notebooks through google CoLab.

## Course Information
This course was developed for a sociology course, <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-34">Health Disparities</a>, at Dartmouth College which explores the interrelations between health outcomes and key sociological concepts such as race, wealth, gender, and other social determinants of health. The course is a lower major level course in the Sociology Department. While there are no prerequisites, most students have completed one or more introductory sociology courses.
